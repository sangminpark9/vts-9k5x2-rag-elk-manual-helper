This may damage the device.  Avoid direct exposure to a high intensity light source. This may damage the image sensor.  Do not install the device under unstable lighting conditions. Severe lighting change will affect the quality of the image produced by the device.  Do not use solvents or thinners to clean the surface of the device. This can damage the surface finish. Power Supply Caution!  Applying incorrect power can damage the camera. If the voltage applied to the camera is greater or less than the camera’s nominal voltage, the camera may be damaged or operate erratically.

If you have dust or foreign matter on the sensor surface that will not blow off, use a soft lint free cotton bud dampened with a small quantity of high quality lens cleaner. Because electrostatic discharge (ESD) can damage the sensor, you must use a cloth (e.g. cotton) that will not generate static during cleaning. Avoid dust or foreign matter on the sensor surface. The camera is shipped with a protective plastic seal on the camera front. To prevent collecting dust or foreign matter on the camera sensor, make sure that you always put the protective seal in place when there is no lens mounted on the camera. In"

Procedures for Cleaning the Sensor If you have dust or foreign matter on the sensor surface, follow the procedures below to wipe off. 1. Remove a contaminant by using an ionizing air gun. If this step does not remove the contaminant, proceed to the next step. 2. Clean the contaminant on the sensor using one drop of lens cleaner on a non-fluffy cotton bud. 3. Wipe the cotton bud gently in only one direction (either left to right or right to left). Avoid wiping back and forth with the same cotton bud to ensure that the contaminants are removed and not simply transferred to a new location on the sensor surface. 4. Mount a lens, set the lens at a smaller aperture (e.g. F8), and then acquire images under bright lighting conditions. Check the images on the monitor for dark spots or stripes caused by the"

In this case, you must adjust one or more of the factors that can influence the maximum allowed line rate and then check to see if the maximum allowed line rate has increased.  The time that it takes to transmit line images out of the camera is the main limiting factor on the line rate. You can decrease the line transmission time (and thus increase the maximum allowed line rate) by doing one or more of the following: - Use an 8 bit pixel data format rather than 12 bit pixel format. Images with fewer bits per pixel will take less time to transmit. - Use a smaller length of ROI. Decreasing the length of ROI means that the camera has less data to transmit and therefore the transmission time will decrease. - Use a CXP Link Configuration with a higher bit rate and number of"

Therefore, it is important to perform the correction in consideration of the camera's settings and environment as needed. Unlike existing VTS cameras, VTS-9K5X2 additionally supports automatic-adjustment function for black level, BlackLevelCalibrationAuto, and a correction function for pixel values depending on temperature changes, OpticalBlackClampCalibration, for optimal image quality. Under normal conditions, it is recommended to perform the correction in the following order: 1. Set the pixel format, line rate, and TDI Stage according to the conditions of use. 2.
